A React Native app capable of reading qr codes and show in a list. All data is manage by redux. You can add, delete or search any link you want.

The app had some bugs:
  1.- The list need to update, every time a new URL is add, need to type something in the searchbar to make the new URL appear.
  2.- by default the first time the scan screen is open it appears in blank and need to click on the scan button.
